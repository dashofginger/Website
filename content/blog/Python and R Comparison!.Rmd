This is a flashback of little me felt trying out statistics and getting the target, but I still feel this little even though I'm about to #adult.

Nevertheless, let's do some coding that anyone can do!  R and Python programming transitions...

```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)

hey<-"We're almost out of here!"
```

In R, I have called on all packages that I will need to coalesce my coding.  Furthermore, I have named a string value entitled "hey" in order to transfer it from R into Python.

# Python

```{python}
import re
hey = "#Texas Ex"
print (r.hey,hey)
```

In this section, we can see how one is able to write and subsequently print out a character for further manipulation in Python to find and indicate certain phrases or characters.  First, I named a subject hey in both R and Python with different values.  I call on Python in this section to print both the R version of the value and the newly named Python version by utilizing the function print with R's code first followed by Python's.


```{python}
import re
text = "Hook 'Em Forever!"
text

re.findall(r"e",text)
```

Assigning a string of characters within a sentence, having "sentence =" or "text =" allows the system to identify what sentence you would like to manipulate.  After that, the function re.findall, which is within the re/regex package functions to find any matches to what you indicate after (r' to find. You specify that it is returned from what you put as your sentence/text.

# Now to R

```{r}
cat(c(hey,py$hey))

r_text<-py$text
```

We can do the same seamless transfer of the object named the same thing (aka "hey"), without conflict of the systems.
