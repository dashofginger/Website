# R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

```{r}
library(reticulate)
library(tidyverse)
library(stringr)
```



# Python

```{python}
import re

text = 'Let us get to CODING!'
re.findall(r'CODING',text)
```
*In this section, we can see how one is able to write and subsequently print out a sentence for further manipulation in Python to find and indicate certain phrases or characters.  Assigning a string of characters within a sentence, having "sentence =" or "text =" allows the system to identify what sentence you would like to manipulate.  After that, the function re.findall, which is within the re/regex package functions to find any matches to what you indicate after (r' to find.  You specify that it is returned from what you put as your sentence/text.*

# Now to R

```{r}
r_sentence<-py$sentence

```
