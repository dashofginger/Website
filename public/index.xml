      <description>This is a flashback of little me felt trying out statistics and getting the target, but I still feel this little even though I’m about to #adult.
 Nevertheless, let’s do some coding that anyone can do! R and Python programming transitions…

      <description>Introduction:
In this project, I have chosen to analyze the datasets provided by the CDC containing average BMI for each state (containing 52 provinces/states of the United States) which gave the correlating state’s name and ranked the states. In the complementary dataset I chose, I looked through the data.gov national data base for a supplemental dataset containing information on urban and rural areas in each state that they were able to gather and the average BMI and correlating average year-long temperature in Farenheit.</description>

      <description>Lauren Conner Lmc3757 INTRODUCTION:
In this project, I will be analyzing the dataset originated from R, presidentialElections from the pacakge pscl that is the democratic share of the presidential vote dated back from 1932-2016 taken by state. This includes a character variable, which is the State that the correlating election data took place in; the binary and simultaneously categorical variable is whether or not this state was considered one of the 11 states of the former Confederacy (“south”); the numerical variables are percent of the vote for president won by the Democratic candidate and year/integer that the election occured.</description>
